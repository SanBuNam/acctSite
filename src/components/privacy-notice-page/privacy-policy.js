        <h3>2. The types of information I collect about you</h3>
        <p>
          Personal information is any information relating to an identified or
          identifiable individual. I may collect, use, store and transfer
          different kinds of personal information about you when I engage with
          you, including:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Identity information including your name, social media ID’s or
            similar identifiers.
          </li>
          <li>
            Contact information including your billing address, email address
            and telephone numbers.

            your login data, browser type and version, time zone setting and
            location, browser plug-in types and versions, operating system and
            platform and other technology on the devices you use to access this
            website.

          <li>Profile information from survey responses.</li>
          <li>
            Usage information including information about how you use my
            Websites, products and services.
          </li>
          <li>

            for receiving marketing from me and my third parties and your
            communication preferences.

        </ul>
        <p>
          Where I refer to personal information in this notice, it might include
          any/all of the above.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also collect, use and share aggregated information. This includes
          statistical or demographic data. Aggregated information may be derived
          from your personal information but is not usually considered personal
          information as this data does not directly or indirectly reveal your
          identity. For example, I may aggregate usage information to calculate
          the percentage of users accessing a specific website feature. However,
          if I combine or connect aggregated information with your personal
          information so that it can directly or indirectly identify you, I
          treat the combined data as personal information which will be used in
          accordance with this privacy notice.
        </p>
        <p>
          I do not generally collect any special categories of personal data
          about you (this includes details about your race or ethnicity,
          religious or philosophical beliefs, sex life, sexual orientation,
          political opinions, trade union membership, information about your
          health and genetic and biometric data). Nor do I collect any
          information about criminal convictions and offences. There may be
          occasions where I have to do a credit reference check on you or you
          business but I will ask for your consent before doing so.
        </p>

          </li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Legitimate interests</h5>
        <p>
          When I use my legitimate interests as the legal basis for processing
          your personal information, I will consider and balance any potential
          impact on you and your rights before I process your personal
          information. I will only then proceed where I believe my interests are
          not overridden by the impact on you. My legitimate interests include
          the interests of my company in conducting and managing my operations
          to enable me to give you the best service and the best and most secure
          experience. Specific examples of this include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Analysis and profiling of my customers</li>
          <li>

        <h5>I resepect your preferences</h5>
        <p>If you would like me to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Stop using your personal information for any of the purposes set out
            above and/or
          </li>
          <li>Stop sending you marketing materials or other communication</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Please <Link to="/contact/">get in touch</Link> at any time and I will
          update my records to reflect your preferences.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can also unsubscribe from my communications (including marketing
          communications) by following the directions to ‘unsubscribe’ set out
          in the communication.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please see section 9 below for more information as to your rights in
          relation to your personal information.
        </p>
        <h5>Engagement periods</h5>
        <p>
          I will generally deem specific consent you have provided me in
          relation to email marketing materials to be valid for the period of 24
          months from the date you last provide me with consent (so that, if you
          do not renew your consent within the 24 month period after you have
          given me consent, I will stop sending you marketing emails). Where I
          rely on legitimate interest as the legal basis for contacting you (for
          example, by post), I may extend this period to 48 months from your
          last engagement with us.
        </p>
        <h5>Cookies</h5>
        <p>
          You can set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to
          alert you when websites set or access cookies. If you disable or

        </p>
        <h5>Change of purpose</h5>
        <p>
          I will only use your personal information for the purposes for which I
          collected it, unless I reasonably consider that I need to use it for
          another reason and that reason is compatible with the original
          purpose. If you wish to get an explanation as to how the processing
          for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please{" "}
          <Link to="/contact/">Contact me</Link>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please note that I may process your personal information without your
          knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this
          is required or permitted by law.
        </p>
        <h5>6. Data security</h5>
        <p>
          I have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your
          personal information from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in
          an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, I limit access
          to your personal information to those employees, agents, contractors
          and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will
          only process your personal information on my instructions and they are
          subject to a duty of confidentiality.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal
          information breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of
          a breach where I are legally required to do so.
        </p>
        <h5>
          7. Data retention - How long I will retain your personal information?
        </h5>
        <p>
          I will only retain your personal information for as long as necessary
          to fulfil the purposes I collected it for, including for the purposes
          of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements and to
          enable me to continue to work with you.
        </p>
        <p>
          To determine the appropriate retention period for personal
          information, I consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the
          personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use
          or disclosure of your personal information, the purposes for which I
          process your personal information and whether I can achieve those
          purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the end of an agreed retention period your information will either
          be securely and confidentially destroyed or anonymized. Anonymization
          is the process of either encrypting or removing personal information
          from data sets, so that it is not possible to identify individuals
          from the data.
        </p>
        <h5>9. Your rights to your personal information</h5>
        <p>
          Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection
          laws in relation to your personal information:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Request access to your personal information (commonly known as a
            “data subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy
            of the personal information I hold about you and to check that I are
            lawfully processing.
          </li>
          <li>
            Request correction of the personal information that I hold about
            you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data I
            hold about you corrected, though I may need to verify the accuracy
            of the new data you provide to us.
          </li>
          <li>
            Request erasure of your personal information. This enables you to
            ask me to delete or remove personal information in certain
            circumstances e.g. where it is no longer necessary for me to retain
            it. Note, however, that I may not always be able to comply with your
            request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified
            to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.
          </li>
          <li>
            Object to processing of your personal information where I are
            relying on the legitimate interest basis (or those of a third party)
            or where I are processing your personal information for direct
            marketing purposes. In some cases, I may demonstrate that I have
            compelling legitimate grounds to process your personal information
            which override your rights and freedoms.
          </li>
          <li>
            Request restriction of processing of your personal information in
            certain circumstances.
          </li>
          <li>
            Request the portability of your personal information to you or to a
            third party. I will provide to you, or a third party you have
            chosen, your personal information in a structured, commonly used,
            machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to
            automated information which you initially provided consent for me to
            use or where I used the information to perform a contract with you.
          </li>
          <li>
            Withdraw consent at any time where I are relying on consent to
            process your personal information. However, this will not affect the
            lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your
            consent. If you withdraw your consent, I may not be able to provide
            certain products or services to you. I will advise you if this is
            the case at the time you withdraw your consent.

          <p>
            You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal information
            (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, I may charge a
            reasonable fee if your request is unfounded, repetitive or
            excessive. Alternatively, I may refuse to comply with your request
            in these circumstances.
          </p>
          <h5>What I may need from you</h5>
          <p>
            I may need to request specific information from you to help me
            confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal
            information (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a
            security measure to ensure that personal information is not
            disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. I may also
            contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your
            request to speed up my response.
          </p>
          <h5>Time limit to respond</h5>
          <p>
            I try to respond to all legitimate requests within 30 days.
            Occasionally it may take me longer than 30 days if your request is
            particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this
            case, I will notify you and keep you updated.
