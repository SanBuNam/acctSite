You want to stay\n          connected to clients and prospective clients, remind them you’re\n          around, show off expertise in your field and let them warm up to your\n          way of thinking.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          A few Twitter posts each week is better than nothing. Add an\n          attractive and well-cultivated Facebook page, robust LinkedIn\n          participation, an occasional blog and professional newsletter and\n          you're golden.\n        </p>\n        <h5>But what if you don't have time? (Or just hate it.)</h5>\n        <p>\n          Web Developers Studio offers a “ghost social” service. We can set up\n          the social media accounts for you, and in a tone appropriate to your\n          message and goals, we post for you.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          If you need a high level of control, we can pre-submit entries to you,\n          and upon approval, schedule them for posting. Alternatively you can\n          grant us more flexibility, so we can post regularly and bother you\n          very little. Either way, outsourcing the routine of it takes one thing\n          off your list.\n        </p>\n        <h5>Reputation Control</h5>\n        <p>\n          Classic case study: a youthfully indiscreet letter is posted on a site\n          that revels in such things. Now what? If your career is suffering from\n          a awkward post or unfortunate professional news item that won't go\n          away, we can assist in the unholy science of reputation control. Let\n          us devise a plan to minimize the damage.{\" \"}\n          <Link to=\"/contact/\">Contact us</Link>.\n        </p>\n        <h5>For Social Media Skeptics</h5>\n        <p>\n          Many wonderfully competent business and professional clients are\n          skeptics about social media. Some have justified concerns about the\n          perils of social media gone awry – for example, our reputation control\n          scenario.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Ok, but you must know: Not having a LinkedIn account now is like not\n          having a business card ten years ago. You could have gotten away with\n          it, made excuses, written your name on a napkin for a prospective\n          client. But you didn't; you had the business cards printed. Why\n          handicap yourself now?\n        </p>\n        <div className={styles.right}>\n          <img alt=\"Social2\" src={Social2} />\n          <p>\n            Have you noticed that you receive fewer phone calls than before?\n            That’s because a phone call is too intrusive for our casual society;\n            it requests attention right now. An email is less demanding, but\n            it's still an interruption to the receiver and implies a response is\n            desired. For some ideas you may want to put out there, it's still\n            too much.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            That's why Twitter is so popular. A \"tweet\" is not even a tap on the\n            shoulder. Whoever sees the post, fine. If they miss it, fine. They\n            might see it later. They might favorite or retweet it. But most\n            won’t. Actually, you’ll get a 100 lurkers for every bit of feedback.\n            The world moves on.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Finally, are your competitors already there? If so, time to get on\n            your game! Even if you really hate it, don’t miss out on the\n            benefits of a well run social media campaign. Have us do it for you.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n        <h5>Put your ad out there</h5>\n        <p>\n          Web Developers Studio holds a Google Adwords MMC account and is a\n          graduate of the Google Engage program. If you need to get attention to\n          your site fast and regularly, AdWords is a great mechanism. You only\n          pay when someone clicks your ad, and you can limit the amount you\n          spend at any time.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Over the first 90 days we work closely with Google to optimize your\n          new AdWords account. Your pay-per-click campaign can be tracked and\n          analyzed carefully. You can run it, or we can do it for you. Our goal\n          is build an advertising campaign that you can easily run after our\n          optimization.\n        </p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </Layout>\n)\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
