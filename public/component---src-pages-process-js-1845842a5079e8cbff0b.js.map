My\n          ability to clearly outline the pros and cons of the many options means\n          that you can be confident you are making a good decision from the\n          get-go.\n        </h5>\n        <h5>\n          I’m not only passionate about website development, but I also\n          understand what it means to run a business and the challenges that go\n          with it. Here I detail my approach to developing and maintaining\n          websites:\n        </h5>\n        <h4>1. Finding out what you want</h4>\n        <p>\n          I strongly believe in content and structure before design. The most\n          important part of a website is your content, because that’s what your\n          clients and customers are engaging with. Content is at the heart of\n          how your visitors perceive your business and is also fundamental to\n          how search engines rank you.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          I use GatherContent – a content production programmer - to help\n          structure and collate all your content. Once we have the initial\n          content structure, I will use rapid prototyping to establish the site\n          structure and flow to maximize its potential in terms of usability and\n          conversion.\n        </p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>- Sitemap</li>\n          <li>- User Stories</li>\n          <li>- Wireframes</li>\n          <li>- Specifications</li>\n          <li>- Prototype</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>\n          Once we have agreed on a direction, we can finalize the paperwork and\n          kick off the project.\n        </p>\n        <h4>2. Starting with content and structure</h4>\n        <p>\n          I strongly believe in content and structure before design. The most\n          important part of a website is your content, because that’s what your\n          clients and customers are engaging with. Content is at the heart of\n          how your visitors perceive your business and is also fundamental to\n          how search engines rank you.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          I use GatherContent – a content production programme - to help\n          structure and collate all your content. Once we have the initial\n          content structure, I will use rapid prototyping to establish the site\n          structure and flow to maximise its potential in terms of usability and\n          conversion.\n        </p>\n        <h4>3. Creating the design</h4>\n        <p>\n          After working out the requirements you can have a design produced\n          based on the functionality you need. A design will ensure your product\n          or site appeals to the right audience. It provides clarity, ease of\n          use and leads to a higher conversion rate and a return on your\n          investment.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Multiple design concepts are a great way of giving you options and\n          steering the designs in the right direction. At the end of this phase,\n          you will have one or more of the following:\n        </p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>- Full designs provided as PSDs</li>\n          <li>- Logo in multiple formats</li>\n          <li>- Styleguide</li>\n        </ul>\n        <h4>4. Building your site</h4>\n        <p>\n          The build phase is straight forward. We will use everything compiled\n          so far such as designs, wireframes and requirements to now jump\n          straight into creating your product or website.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          I work using Agile and SCRUM. This means that all tasks are\n          prioritised from most to least important. I manage the tasks using\n          MeisterTask for smaller sites and JIRA for larger sites. Some clients\n          prefer to use Basecamp. The backlog is visible to you and gives you\n          the opportunity to prioritise tasks you want me to work on first –\n          usually those with the highest value.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          I work through a select list of items from the backlog on a weekly or\n          fortnightly basis (known as a sprint) after which I will run a demo.\n          I’ll share progress updates with you and give you the chance to change\n          tasks as we develop. Demos with progress reports will give you\n          confidence that your project is on track and within budget.\n        </p>\n        <h4>5. Ensuring quality</h4>\n        <p>\n          Each task will be tested for quality assurance (QA) at the end of each\n          sprint. Another round of QA testing will be performed at the end of\n          your project. A final QA exit report will give you reassurance that\n          your site works in all browser and device combinations agreed. Any\n          issues will be fixed as they are uncovered.\n        </p>\n        <h4>6. Going live</h4>\n        <p>\n          Once you’ve done your final user acceptance testing and are confident\n          your requirements have been met, I will setup your production hosting\n          environment. Finally, I’ll deploy your site live.\n        </p>\n        <h4>7. Post go live maintenance and improvements</h4>\n        <p>\n          Up to 4 weeks after going live you’ll receive bug fixes free of\n          charge.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Any additional changes can be discussed and estimated on a per-case\n          basis and fixed on an hourly rate.\n        </p>\n        <h4>8. Maintaining your website</h4>\n        <p>\n          You may want me to take care of the maintenance of your website. Here\n          are some of the tools and methodologies I use:\n        </p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>1. Signed up to receive Drupal Security updates</li>\n          <li>\n            2.
