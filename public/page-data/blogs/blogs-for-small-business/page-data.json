Since 1999, the number of blogs on the Internet has exploded from a few thousand to over 100 million.</p>\n<p>Blogs can fall into two general categories.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Personal Blogs: a mixture of a personal diary, opinion posts and research links.\nBusiness Blogs: a corporate tool for communicating with customers or employees to share knowledge and expertise.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Business blogs are sweeping the business community.
