We’ll\n            start with you at square one, help you pick out and purchase a\n            domain, often at a discount, and stay with you throughout the\n            creation, promotion, and care and keeping of your website.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Great{\" \"}\n            <span style={{ fontWeight: \"600\", color: \"#263248\" }}>\n              SEO (search engine optimization)\n            </span>{\" \"}\n            starts at the beginning. You’re the subject matter expert, but you\n            might not know the words that your potential clients and customers\n            are typing into the search engines.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            For example, we worked with our client,{\" \"}\n            <span>gynecologist Dr. Cindy Parnes</span>, to determine which parts\n            of her practice to emphasize. Together we hunted through her\n            services and attributes to find the best keywords. After a series of\n            tests, we found a few with search results through the roof. That\n            boost sent her website much higher in Google’s results than most\n            private doctors. Our careful, attentive, and personalized SEO\n            development found just the right leverage. The little techniques add\n            up – Dr. Parnes happily reports that her website continues to draw\n            in new patients.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Another of our clients,{\" \"}\n            <span>Elizabeth Lindberg, a Swedish massage therapist</span>, paid\n            thousands of dollars to an “SEO specialist” who “wrote articles” for\n            her and promised top rankings. But they never got her website to the\n            first pages of Google results for her keywords within her own\n            hometown. Then she came to us. Web Developers Studio took her domain\n            and worked with her closely. After a few weeks of being live with\n            us, she showed up in Google searches for her keywords with her town,\n            then with her county, and now she is the top return for her keywords\n            in her state.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Along the top and right side of search engines’ results pages are\n            paid ads (incidentally, <span>another of our services</span>) but\n            most users know the results beneath the paid ads are the organically\n            generated results that show up based on the merit of their own\n            content and coding. The site owners do not pay the search engines\n            for the exposure.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            In addition to brainstorming alongside you, our team uses the most\n            competitive SEO coding techniques on every page of your website. We\n            avoid old-fashioned formats, like tables, which are still common but\n            hard for search engines to parse. With the exception of our least\n            expensive <span>package</span>, our websites are hand-coded to\n            produce these excellent results. We combine your intimate knowledge\n            of your business with our web expertise to optimize your website for\n            the most possible “foot-traffic.”\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Let's start with a <span>comprehensive review</span> together.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </Layout>\n)\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
